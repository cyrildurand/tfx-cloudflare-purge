# Purge Cache for Cloudflare

Azure DevOps build/release task for purging everything from your Cloudflare cache.  

To automate this *Purge Everything* task, you'll need:

* Your cloudflare user name (this is an email address)
* Cloudflare Global API Key
  * Cloudflare > My Profile > Global API Key > View
* Zone you want to purge (one of your domains)
  * Cloudflare > Home

This task is the same as logging into Cloudflare and using the Caching > Purge Cache > Purge Everything function.
